      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Nike was founded in 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight. In 1971, it rebranded as Nike, named after the Greek goddess of victory. The brandâ€™s first shoe, the Nike Cortez, became a major success, followed by the introduction of Air cushioning technology in 1978.
Nike revolutionized the sneaker world with the launch of Air Jordan in 1984, turning basketball shoes into a cultural icon. Innovations like Air Max (1987), Flyknit, and ZoomX Vaporfly have kept Nike at the forefront of performance and style.
Today, Nike continues to lead the industry, blending technology, comfort, and fashion, making it one of the most influential sportswear brands worldwide.</p>
